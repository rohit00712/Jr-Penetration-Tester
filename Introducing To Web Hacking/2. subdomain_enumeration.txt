 Three different subdomain enumeration methods: Brute Force, OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and Virtual Host.
1. OSINT-SSL/TLS Certificates
 https://crt.sh
 https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui

2. OSINT-Search Engines
" -site:www.tryhackme.com  site:*.tryhackme.com" It will only reveal a subdomain for tryhackme.com

3. DNS Bruteforce
dnsrecon is the tool used to bruteforce the DNS record of the given websites
dnsrecon -t brt -d acmeitsupport.thm

4. OSINT-Sublist3r
./sublist3r.py -d acmeitsupport.thm

5. Virtual Hosts
Some subdomains aren't always hosted in publically accessible DNS results, such as development versions
 of a web application or administration portals. Instead, the DNS record could be kept on a private DNS
 server or recorded on the developer's machines in their /etc/hosts file (or c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts 
file for Windows users) which maps domain names to IP addresses. 

ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://MACHINE_IP

To limit the output:
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://MACHINE_IP -fs {size}

ffuf -w /home/kali/Downloads/SecLists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://10.10.63.176 -fs 2395
